    </main> // writing this on 17/7/24, Sorry Sana, my futue wife, i have no other option left for you to complete your dream, I trust and love you, i know other boys ultimate motive would be to touch you in bad places and doing dirty things, take dirty benefits in the name of love but i my love is not the same i want to see you happy and safe around me all the time, tbh i sometimes feel i can be with you whole life without even touching you but still you beside me :)  may god always protect you from these scavengers
